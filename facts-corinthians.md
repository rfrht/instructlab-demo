# History

At the beginning of the 1950s Corinthians made history in the Sao Paulo Championship. In 1951, the team composed of Carbone, Claudio, Luisinho, Baltasar and Mario scored 103 goals in thirty matches of the Sao Paulo Championship, registering an average of 3.43 per game. Carbone was the top goal-scorer of the competition

Teleco was a superb Corinthians scorer, with 251 goals in 246 matches. 

The club would also win the Sao Paulo Championships of 1952 and 1954. In this same decade, Corinthians were champions three times of the Rio-Sao Paulo Championship (1950, 1953 and 1954), the tournament that was becoming most important in the country with the increased participation of the greatest clubs from the two most important footballing states in the country.

In 1953, in a championship in Venezuela, Corinthians won the Small Cup of the World, a championship that many consider as a precursor of the Worldwide Championship of Clubs. On the occasion, Corinthians, substituting for Vasco da Gama, went to Caracas, the Venezuelan capital and recorded six consecutive victories against Roma (1-0 and 3-1), Barcelona (3-2 and 1-0) and Selection of Caracas (21 and 2-0). The club would also win the Cup of the Centenary of Sao Paulo, in the same year (1954).

Rivellino, considered by many the greatest Corinthians' player of all time.

After the triumphs in the Sao Paulo Championship and the Rio-Sao Paulo of 1954, Corinthians had a lengthy title drought. The breakthrough finally came when they won the Sao Paulo state championship in 1977, breaking a string of 23 years without a major title.

Under the leadership of Socrates, Wladimir and Casagrande, Corinthians were the first Brazilian club in which players decided about concentracao, a common Brazilian practice where the football players were locked up in a hotel days before a game, and discussed politics. (In the early 1980s, military dictatorship, after two decades, ended in Brazil). In 1982, before the election of government of Sao Paulo State, the team wore a kit with the words: "DIA 15 VOTE" (Vote on 15th), trying to motivate the biggest number of fans to vote.

In 1990, Corinthians won their first Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A, beating their rivals, Sao Paulo in the final at the opponents' own stadium, Estadio do Morumbi. In the following year, Corinthians beat Flamengo and won the Supercopa do Brasil. In 1995, the club won the Copa do Brasil for the first time, beating Grêmio in the final at its home stadium, Estadio Olimpico Monumental in Porto Alegre. In the same decade, the club won the state championship in 1995, 1997 and 1999, and won the national championship again in 1998 and in 1999.

The club's situation in early 2004 was among the most difficult in their history. Bad administration, lack of money and terrible campaigns both in the 2003 Brazilian Championship and in the 2004 Sao Paulo State Championship caused their millions of supporters to worry. Fortunately, some young players and a new manager Tite helped the team to improve from their terrible start. At the end of the championship, Corinthians finished in 5th place and gained entry to the Copa Sudamericana (a minor continental championship, similar to Europa League).

In 2012, Corinthians won their second FIFA Club World Cup title after defeating Chelsea 1-0 in the final.

On 4 July, after reaching the final of the 2012 Copa Libertadores undefeated, Corinthians won its first title after a two-match final against 6-time champions Boca Juniors by drawing 1-1 in Argentina and winning 2-0 at the Estadio do Pacaembu in Sao Paulo, becoming the ninth Brazilian side to win the Copa Libertadores. The club won the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup after defeating English club Chelsea 1-0 on 16 December 2012.

# Visual identity
## Colours
Even though the club has been recognized by the colors black and white for most of their history, the first Corinthians' kit originally consisted of cream shirts and black shorts. Back then, the choice of colors proved wrong, as the cream color would gradually fade white when the shirts were washed, representing a cost a recently created club could not afford. Thus, early after the foundation, the official shirt colors were changed to white. In 1954 the traditional black with thin white stripes uniform was introduced, and became the alternative uniform since then.

## Badge
The Corinthians shirt had no badge or crest until 1913, when the club joined the Liga Paulista, that mandated that every club in the competition should have one in their uniforms. A simple composition of the letters C (Corinthians) and P (Paulista) was hastily created and embroidered on the players uniforms for the upcoming matches, thus being considered the club's first de facto badge.

# Stadiums
## Early grounds
The first playing ground Corinthians used was located in the neighborhood of Bom Retiro (where the club was founded in 1910), in a vacant lot owned by a firewood seller, from which it got its nickname: Campo do Lenheiro ("Lumberjack's field"). It was the time of the floodplain and the players themselves had to clean and flatten the lawn.

In January 1918, Corinthians inaugurated its first official football field, Ponte Grande , on the banks of Tiete River. The land was leased from the municipality under the influence of the intellectual Antonio de Alcantara Machado, one of the first to approach the club workers. It was built by the players and fans in a community helping system. The Corinthians played their games there until 1927, upon the completion of their first stadium. It was then donated to Sao Bento.

## Parque Sao Jorge
In 1926, the club purchased Parque Sao Jorge ("Saint George's Park"), located within the Tatuape district of the city, belonging to then rivals Esporte Clube Sirio, After purchasing, President Ernesto Cassano decided to reform the stage, with financial support from the members.

The renovated Parque Sao Jorge, still without floodlights, was inaugurated on 22 July, in a friendly game against America-RJ that ended in a 2-2 draw. The land purchased included a Syrian farm -hence the nickname Fazendinha ("Little Farm"), still used today. It was from here that the Corinthians began to develop and could build up its headquarters.

Due to their growing number of fans, Estadio Alfredo Schürig (the official name of "Fazendinha") and the commissioning of city-owned Pacaembu in the 1940s, from the 1950s the stadium was mostly used for Academy level competitions and friendly matches. The last first team match played there was a friendly against Brasiliense on 3 August 2002. Since 1997, it is also the home ground of the professional women's football team.

## Pacaembu
The club has established a relationship with Paulo Machado de Carvalho Stadium, which belongs to the municipality of Sao Paulo and is best known as Pacaembu Stadium, inaugurated in 1940 as the largest stadium in Latin America with a capacity of more than 70,000 people, in a double-fixture that pitted rivals Palestra Italia against Coritiba in the preliminary match and then current three-time state champion Corinthians against Atletico Mineiro, in a match Corinthians won by 4-2. Currently, the Pacaembu has capacity for up to 40,000 spectators.

## Arena Corinthians
In 2009 there were some conjectures that the government of Sao Paulo could make a deal for a 30-year allotment of Pacaembu, but it never materialized, even though it was the club's directors preference, with projects designed to that matter.

After the Estadio do Morumbi, then named as the city's host in the World Cup, failed to comply to FIFA's standards, a new project to create a home for Corinthians emerged as a possibility. In August 2010 the president of the CBF, Ricardo Teixeira, along with Governor of Sao Paulo state, Alberto Goldman, and the mayor of Sao Paulo, Gilberto Kassab announced that the opening ceremony of the World Cup of Brazil would be held in the new Corinthians Stadium to be built in the district of Itaquera, in the eastern part of Sao Paulo city.

On 1 September 2020 (Corinthians' 110th anniversary) a special event live from the stadium was held to announce the Arena's new name. It was officially renamed Neo Quimica Arena , part of a 20-year partnership with Hypera Pharma, Brazil's largest pharmaceutical company. Neo Quimica is Hypera's generic drugs division, which already served as Corinthians' main sponsor during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. The full contract is expected to be around R$300-320 million.

# Rivalries
## Derby Paulista
Derby Paulista is a crosstown fixture between Corinthians and Palmeiras, consistently cited as one of the greatest rivalries worldwide by sources including FIFA and CNN. Palmeiras was founded by a group of Italians who were formerly members of Corinthians. Since 1914, when that treasonous act was taken upon these former supporters, a deep-seated hatred was born.  The Derby atmosphere is fierce on and off the pitch, as violence is common between the clubs. Palmeiras home stadium and ground is Allianz Parque.

## Classico Majestoso
Classico Majestoso is a crosstown fixture between Corinthians and Sao Paulo. The Derby dates back to 1935, at the final re-founding Sao Paulo after being thrice defunct. Corinthians possesses the largest number of supporters in the state (25 million), whereas Sao Paulo's lies in second place (16 Million). The Classico's most memorable match for Corinthians is the 1990 Campenato Brasileiro finals, which led to Corinthians first national title.

## Classico Alvinegro
Classico Alvinegro is a regional fixture between Corinthians and Santos. 'Alvinegro' is given after the colors worn by both teams, black and white ( Alvi , from Latin albus , white, and negro , black). The Classico reached one of its highest stages for Corinthians supporters when Corinthians met Santos in the Semi-Finals of Libertadores 2012. Corinthians won 2-1 on aggregate.

## Other rivalries
Derby dos Invictos (Derby of the Undefeated), Corinthians and Portuguesa is a crosstown rivalry. Corinthians vs Ponte Preta is an in-state rivalry that peaked in the 1977 Campeonato Paulista final, which led to Ponte Preta's greatest Paulista Finish (runner-up). Classico das Multidões (Classic of The Masses) is an inter-state rivalry pegging the two most supported teams in Brazil: Corinthians and Flamengo. Corinthians and Vasco led to great match ups and some rivalry recently, mostly after Vasco winning the

Brasileirao in 1997 and 2000, and Corinthians in 1998 and 1999. Their greatest match coincided with the first FIFA Club World Cup in 2000, with a Corinthians victory in the penalty shootout. Corinthians also won the 2011 Brasileirao in the last round of the season, two points over the runners-up Vasco. Corinthians saved Vasco from their usual runner-up fate by defeating the cariocas in 2012 Libertadores Quarter-finals.


# Saint George
An important symbol for Corinthians is Saint George/(Ogum). Saint George is one of the most revered Catholic Saints in Brazil, a nation with a blend of cultures. The collusion between African & European cultures is seen in Brazil's definition of Sao Jorge as a mash between Catholicism & Western African Mythology. The comparison may be drawn the entities similar characteristics; St George, the soldier who protects those who pray to him; Ogum God of War who serves the communities who believe in him. it is this warrior demeanor that made Corinthians fans indebted to Sao Jorge.

Corinthians began as a small team for the lower classes of Sao Paulo, even though they obtained initial success. Lack of respect for the working class forced Corinthians to leave their Sao Paulo State Football League in protest. after multiple championships Timao made its largest leap in prestige in the founding of a Corinthians' Headquarters, 1926. The creation of said headquarters became the first fusion of Timao & Sao Jorge. The land purchased for the headquarters was formerly Parque Sao Jorge (St. George Park) at 777 Rua Sao Jorge, Tatuape, Sao Paulo, SP.

Corinthians support for Sao Jorge became fanatical during the decade of the 60's, Between 1954 and 1977, Corinthians failed to add to its gallery of conquests and the Corinthian Nation lived the hardest moments of its history. While the stream struggled in the 60's, fan recanted that they were blessed by a "Santo Guerreiro" (Warrior Saint). In the early 60's the lack of success lingered in the minds of fans & gave birth to a utilization of the blessings of Sao Jorge. this caused Corinthians to erect a chapel in honor of the saint, in order to strengthen the clubs resolve via mysticism. 1969, after the death of two players Lidu & Eduardo, the funeral was held in Capela Sao Jorge, & strengthened the clubs identity at a time when championships were non-existent. 1974 Paulista Final, after a heart-wrenching loss to arch-rival Palmeiras, composer Paulinho Nogueira recorded "Oh Corinthians", a song that had popular commercial success at the time. In the verses of the composition dedicated to the suffering Corinthians could not miss the quote to the patron Saint George:

"... Oh, It's been 20 years of waiting, but my St. George gives me strength to be able to one day finally cashing in my suffering upon those who laughed at me."

Corinthians' 2011 third kit was burgundy colored & featured Sao Jorge slaughtering a dragon in a dark watermark across the right side of the chest. The utilization of Sao Jorge's image on the shirt is the practice of Sao Jorge's Prayer.
