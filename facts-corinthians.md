## History

In 1910, the top clubs were formed by people who were part of the upper classes. [5] Among them were Club Athletico Paulistano , Sao Paulo Athletic Club ,$^{[6]}$ & Associacao Atletica das Palmeiras . [7] Lower-class society, excluded from larger clubs due to the socioeconomic division, founded their own minnow clubs and only played "floodplain" football.

Bucking the trend, a group of five workers of the Sao Paulo Railway, them being, Joaquim Ambrose and Anthony Pereira (wall painters), Rafael Perrone (shoemaker), Anselmo Correia

(driver) and Carlos Silva (general laborer), residents of the neighborhood of Bom Retiro. It was 31 August 1910 when these workers were watching a match featuring a London-based club touring Brazil, Corinthian F.C. $^{[8]}$ After the match, while the group returned home, the men talked about partnerships, business ideas, and general dreams of grandeur. They each surfaced one idea: the foundation of a club, after several exchanges in a lively argument, a common ground led those athletes the same dream. The arguments led to the conclusion that they would meet the next day to make their dream into reality.

On 1 September 1910, the group agreed to meet after sundown in public sight. That night at 8:30pm, on Rua Jose Paulino ("Rua dos Imigrantes" (Immigrants Street), the five workers reunited alongside their guest and neighbors from Bom Retiro. That night the club was founded, alongside its board of directors, who elected Miguel Battaglia as the first Club President. [8]

Corinthians played their first match on 10 September 1910, away against Uniao da Lapa, a respected amateur club in Sao Paulo, and they were defeated by 1-0.

On 14 September, Luis Fabi scored Corinthians' first goal against Estrela Polar , another amateur club in the city, and Corinthians won their first game (2-0).

With good results and an increasing number of supporters, Corinthians joined the Liga Paulista, after winning two qualifying games, and played in the Sao Paulo State Championship for the first time, in 1913. Just one year after joining the league, Corinthians was crowned champion for the first time (in 1914), and were again two years later. There were many fly-by-night teams popping up in Sao Paulo at the time, and during the first practice held by Corinthians a banner was placed by the side of the field stating "This One Will Last".

1922, the Centennial of Brazilian Independence, marks the start of Corinthians hegemony in the Sao Paulo State Championship. As football was almost exclusively played at Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo by that time, the two state champions were considered to be the two top clubs in Brazil. After defeating the Rio de Janeiro State Championship champion of that year, America, Corinthians joined the company of the great teams in Brazil.

The same year also marked the first of three State Championships in a row, something that happened again in 1928-30 and 1937-39.

Corinthians seemed destined to win State Championships in threes; after six years without being a champions, they came won three more from 1937 the 1939. The 1940s were a more difficult time; and the club would win a championship in 1941 and would only win their next in 1951.

At the beginning of the 1950s Corinthians made history in the Sao Paulo Championship. In 1951, the team composed of Carbone, Claudio, Luisinho, Baltasar and Mario scored 103 goals in thirty matches of the Sao Paulo Championship, registering an average of 3.43 per game. Carbone was the top goal-scorer of the competition

Teleco was a superb Corinthians scorer, with 251 goals in 246 matches. He became the top scorer of the Paulista Championships of 1935, 1936, 1937, 1939 and 1941. His nickname was "O rei das viradas" ( The king of comebacks ).

with 30 goals. The club would also win the Sao Paulo Championships of 1952 and 1954. In this same decade, Corinthians were champions three times of the Rio-Sao Paulo Championship (1950, 1953 and 1954), the tournament that was becoming most important in the country with the increased participation of the greatest clubs from the two most important footballing states in the country.

In 1953, in a championship in Venezuela, Corinthians won the Small Cup of the World, a championship that many consider as a precursor of the Worldwide Championship of Clubs. On the occasion, Corinthians, substituting for Vasco da Gama, went to Caracas, the Venezuelan capital and recorded six consecutive victories against Roma (1-0 and 3-1), Barcelona (3-2 and 1-0) and Selection of Caracas (21 and 2-0). The club would also win the Cup of the Centenary of Sao Paulo, in the same year (1954).

After the triumphs in the Sao Paulo Championship and the Rio-Sao Paulo of 1954, Corinthians had a lengthy title drought. The breakthrough finally came when they won the Sao Paulo state championship in 1977, breaking a string of 23 years without a major title.

Under the leadership of Socrates, Wladimir and Casagrande, Corinthians were the first Brazilian club in which players decided about concentracao, a common Brazilian practice where the football players were locked up in a hotel days before a game, and discussed politics. (In the early 1980s, military dictatorship, after two decades, ended in Brazil). In 1982, before the election of government of Sao Paulo State, the team wore a kit with the words: "DIA 15 VOTE" (Vote on 15th), [9] trying to motivate the biggest number of fans to vote.

In 1990, Corinthians won their first Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A, beating their rivals, Sao Paulo in the final at the opponents' own stadium, Estadio do Morumbi . [10] In the following year, Corinthians beat Flamengo and won the Supercopa do Brasil .$^{[11]}$ In the 1995 , the club won the Copa do Brasil for the first time, beating Grêmio in the final at the Estadio Olimpico Monumental in Porto Alegre .$^{[12]}$ In the same decade, the club won the state championship in 1995, 1997 and 1999, [13] and won the national championship again in 1998 and in 1999. [14] In 2000, the club won the first FIFA Club World Cup , eliminating Real Madrid in the semifinals and beating Vasco da Gama on penalties in the final. [15]

In 2002 the club won the Rio-Sao Paulo Tournament, and the Copa do Brasil in 2002, beating Brasiliense in the final. [16]

The club's situation in early 2004 was among the most difficult in their history. Bad administration, lack of money and terrible campaigns both in the 2003 Brazilian Championship and in the 2004 Sao Paulo State Championship caused their millions of supporters to worry. Fortunately, some young players and a new manager Tite helped the team to improve from their terrible start. At the end of the championship, Corinthians finished in 5th place and gained entry to the Copa Sudamericana (a minor continental championship, similar to Europa League).

This situation was one of the factors which enabled Corinthians' president, Alberto Dualib, to convince the club's advisors to sign a controversial deal with an international fund of investors called Media Sports Investment. The deal granted the company a large degree of control over the club for 10 years in exchange for large financial investments in return. This has brought many quality players to the team, such as Carlos Tevez, Roger, Javier Mascherano and Carlos Alberto.

Despite the MSI investments, Corinthians experienced a slow start in the 2005 state championship, but managed to improve as it progressed, eventually managing to finish second. Their start to the Brazilian championship during 2005 was difficult, too, but after Daniel Passarella's dismissal (due to an unexpected 5-1 loss to Corinthians' rivals, Sao Paulo), the club finished the championship round well, and were eventually crowned Brazilian Champions for the fourth time, after a controversial annulment of eleven games due to a betting scandal. Tevez went on to win the Brazilian League Best Player award.

The relationship between Corinthians' managers and the MSI president, Kia Joorabchian was not good, and after being eliminated in the Copa Libertadores, the club experienced a crisis which was responsible for the bad performances for the rest of 2006. Eventually, the partnership came to an end. [17]

On 2 December 2007, following a 1-1 draw away to Grêmio, Corinthians were relegated to the second division for the first time in the club history.

Corinthians, who won promotion to the top division of Brazilian football for 2009 by winning the Serie B tournament in 2008, with the best campaign in the history of the tournament, signed with three-time FIFA Player of the Year , Ronaldo . [18][19] In 2009, led by Ronaldo, Corinthians won their 26th Campeonato Paulista and their third Brazilian Cup. Confirming the club's good moment, and the 100 years of the club, Corinthians announced the construction of their new stadium, Arena Corinthians, they finished the Campeonato Brasileiro 2010 in 3rd place, granting their place on the subsequent Copa Libertadores. After being eliminated from the South American tournament by the country rivals, Flamengo, though, Corinthians saw Ronaldo retire from football. To replace him, the club signed the with Inter Milan legend, Adriano .$^{[20]}$ In 2011, Corinthians once again were eliminated in the Copa Libertadores, but this time in the playoff round by Deportes Tolima. After that, the team went on to win their fifth national title.

In 2012, Corinthians won their second FIFA Club World Cup title after defeating Chelsea 1-0 in the final.

On 4 July, after reaching the final of the 2012 Copa Libertadores undefeated, Corinthians won its first title after a two-match final against 6-time champions Boca Juniors by drawing 1-1 in Argentina and winning 2-0 at the Estadio do Pacaembu in Sao Paulo, becoming the ninth Brazilian side to win the Copa Libertadores. [21][22] The club won the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup after defeating English club Chelsea 1-0 on 16 December 2012. [23][24][25]

In 2015, the team started the year by being eliminated in the Campeonato Paulista semifinal, and then being eliminated in Libertadores and Brazilian Cup last 16, but went on to win their sixth league title.$^{[26]}$ In 2017 the team started the year winning

the Campeonato Paulista for the 28th time, and ending the year winning the league title for the second time in three years, and doing a historic campaign by not losing in the first 20 games of the season.$^{[27]}$ In 2018, the team won the Campeonato Paulista for the 29th time, this time against their biggest rivals, Palmeiras. In 2019, Corinthians won the Campeonato Paulista for the 30th time.

In 2020, Corinthians lost the Campeonato Paulista final to arch rivals Palmeiras on penalties. In the league they finished only 10 points ahead of the first team in the relegation zone, that was the first season since 2007 that Corinthians fought against relegation. In 2021 the new president of the club brought back Willian who had left the club in 2007,$^{[28]}$ helping Corinthians to finish in 5th, granting the club to the Copa Libertadores playoffs. In 2022 Corinthians had their best league season since 2017, finishing in 4th place, granting their place on the subsequent Copa Libertadores. In the Libertadores, the team finished in 2nd in the group stage, then went on to eliminate Boca Juniors in La Bombonera on penalties, reaching the quarter finals for the first time since 2012,$^{[29]}$ but were eliminated to Flamengo. In the Brazilian Cup, they lost once again to Flamengo, but this time at the final, on a penalty shoot out.$^{[30]}$ After all, it was considered the club's best season since 2017.

In 2023, despite being eliminated from Libertadores, the club reached the Copa Sulamericana semifinals, where they were eliminated by Fortaleza. In the league once again fought against relegation.

## Visual identity

## Colours

Even though the club has been recognized by the colors black and white for most of their history, the first Corinthians' kit originally consisted of cream shirts and black shorts. Back then, the choice of colors proved wrong, as the cream color would gradually fade white when the shirts were washed, representing a cost a recently created club could not afford. Thus, early after the foundation, the official shirt colors were changed to white. In 1954 the traditional black with thin white stripes uniform was introduced, and became the alternative uniform since then.

## Badge

The Corinthians shirt had no badge or crest until 1913, when the club joined the Liga Paulista, that mandated that every club in the competition should have one in their uniforms. A simple composition of the letters C (Corinthians) and P (Paulista) was hastily created and embroidered on the players uniforms for the upcoming matches, thus being considered the club's first de facto badge. [31]

Unlike the kit, the badge went through several changes over the years. In 1914, lithographer Hermogenes Barbuy, brother of thenplayer Amilcar Barbuy designed the club's first official badge, which premiered at a friendly against Torino (Italy), in Sao Paulo.$^{[32]}$ In 1919, the round shield with the Sao Paulo state flag was introduced, and modified in 1939 by modernist painter Francisco Rebolo, a former reserve player of the club in the 1920s, to include a string, an anchor and two oars, representing the early success the club achieved in nautical sports. Thereafter, the badge

passed through small changes over time, specifically in the flag and in the frame. [31]

In 1990, a yellow star was added above the badge to celebrate Corinthians' first national title. The same would occur when achieving the national titles in 1998, 1999 and 2005, and a larger star was introduced in 2000 after winning the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup. The stars remained as part of the badge until 2011, when the board decided the badge would not present any stars in the future.

## Facilities

## Stadiums

## Early grounds

The first playing ground Corinthians used was located in the neighborhood of Bom Retiro (where the club was founded in 1910), in a vacant lot owned by a firewood seller, from which it got its nickname: Campo do Lenheiro ("Lumberjack's field"). It was the time of the floodplain and the players themselves had to clean and flatten the lawn.

In January 1918, Corinthians inaugurated its first official football field, Ponte Grande , on the banks of Tiete River. The land was leased from the municipality under the influence of

the intellectual Antonio de Alcantara Machado, one of the first to approach the club workers. It was built by the players and fans in a community helping system. The Corinthians played their games there until 1927, upon the completion of their first stadium. It was then donated to Sao Bento.

## Parque Sao Jorge

In 1926, the club purchased Parque Sao Jorge ("Saint George's Park"), located within the Tatuape district of the city, belonging to then rivals Esporte Clube Sirio, After purchasing, President Ernesto Cassano decided to reform the stage, with financial support from the members.

The renovated Parque Sao Jorge, still without floodlights, was inaugurated on 22 July, in a friendly game against America-RJ that ended in a 2-2 draw. The land purchased included a Syrian farm -hence the nickname Fazendinha ("Little Farm"), still used today. It was from here that the Corinthians began to develop and could build up its headquarters.

Due to their growing number of fans, Estadio Alfredo Schürig (the official name of "Fazendinha") and the commissioning of city-owned Pacaembu in the 1940s, from the 1950s the stadium was mostly used for Academy level competitions and friendly matches. The last first team match played there was a friendly against Brasiliense on 3 August 2002. Since 1997, it is also the home ground of the professional women's football team.

## Pacaembu

The club has established a relationship with Paulo Machado de Carvalho Stadium, which belongs to the municipality of Sao Paulo and is best known as Pacaembu Stadium, inaugurated in 1940 as the largest stadium in Latin America with a capacity of more than 70,000 people, in a double-fixture that pitted rivals Palestra Italia against Coritiba in the preliminary match and then current three-time state champion Corinthians against Atletico Mineiro, in a match Corinthians won by 4-2. Currently, the Pacaembu has capacity for up to 40,000 spectators.

## Arena Corinthians

In 2009 there were some conjectures that the government of Sao Paulo could make a deal for a 30-year allotment of Pacaembu, but it never materialized, even though it was the club's directors preference, with projects designed to that matter.

After the Estadio do Morumbi, then named as the city's host in the World Cup, failed to comply to FIFA's standards, a new project to create a home for Corinthians emerged as a possibility. In August 2010 the president of the CBF, Ricardo Teixeira, along with Governor of Sao Paulo state, Alberto Goldman, and the mayor of Sao Paulo, Gilberto Kassab announced that the opening ceremony of the World Cup of Brazil would be held in the new Corinthians Stadium to be built in the district of Itaquera, in the eastern part of Sao Paulo city.

On 1 September 2020 (Corinthians' 110th anniversary) a special event live from the stadium was held to announce the Arena's new name. It was officially renamed Neo Quimica Arena , part of a 20-year partnership with Hypera Pharma, Brazil's largest pharmaceutical company. Neo Quimica is Hypera's generic drugs division, which already served as Corinthians' main sponsor during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. The full contract is expected to be around R$300-320 million. [34]

## Training facilities

## CT Joaquim Grava

Corinthians inaugurated their state-of-the-art training facilities in September, 2010 during the celebrations of the club's 100th anniversary. The training facilities were named after long-time associate and consulting medical doctor, Joaquim Grava, that oversaw the medical department construction.

The training facilities feature a 32 bedroom hotel for the players, a bio-mechanics complex (Lab Corinthians-R9. named after Brazilian legend Ronaldo), a center for player rehabilitation and therapy (CePROO, named after fan and journalist Osmar de Oliveira), basketball and volleyball courts (approved by FIBA and FIVB for official matches), as well as other amenities.

An extension to be used by the Academy teams is currently under construction.

## Club culture

## Supporters

The Corinthians fan base is fondly called Fiel ("The Faithful"), starring memorable moments like the "Corinthian Invasion" (pt / Invasao Corinthiana ) in 1976, when more than 70,000 Corinthians Fans traveled from Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro to watch the match against Fluminense at Maracana Stadium, in that year's national championship semifinals, as well as having one of the biggest average attendances in the country. Fans being famous for being passionate about the team and loyal supporters motivated the club to make a tribute documentary to their fans, named "Faithful" (pt / Fiel ), highlighting the fans' support in one

<!-- image -->

of the most difficult moments in the club's history: the relegation to national second division in 2007. Similar initiatives would be made in the next years, reflecting other moments in the club's history in that the fanbase was essential.

Integral to the club culture are the fan organizations ("torcidas organizadas") such as Gaviões da Fiel ("The Hawks of the Faithful"), founded in 1969 by fans attempting to recover political and administrative control of the club and now the largest of such organizations in Brazil with almost 100,000 associates. [35] Camisa 12 ("The 12th Shirt", founded in 1971), Estopim da Fiel ("Faithful's Fuse", 1979), Coringao

Chopp ("Corinthians Draught Beer", 1989), Pavilhao Nove ("Pavillion Nine", 1990), and Fiel Macabra ("Macabre Faithful", 1993) are other important fan organizations that have been actively supporting social and cultural activities representing the club.

Many of the groups above have established branches for fans living outside of Sao Paulo city, out-state and even internationally. Most are also involved in the Brazilian Carnival festivities, most famously Gaviões da Fiel, one of the most important Carnival of Sao Paulo samba schools, having won the contest 4 times, the most among groups of football supporters.

## Rivalries

## Derby Paulista

Derby Paulista is a crosstown fixture between Corinthians and Palmeiras, consistently cited as one of the greatest rivalries worldwide by sources including FIFA $^{[36]}$ and CNN .$^{[37]}$ Palmeiras was founded by a group of Italians who were formerly members of Corinthians. [38] Since 1914, when that treasonous act was taken upon these former supporters, a deep-seated hatred was born. [38] The Derby atmosphere is fierce on and off the pitch, as violence is common between the clubs. [39][40]

## Classico Majestoso

Classico Majestoso is a crosstown fixture between Corinthians and Sao Paulo. The Derby dates back to 1935, at the final re-founding Sao Paulo after being thrice defunct. Corinthians possesses the largest number of supporters in the state (25 million), whereas Sao Paulo's lies in second place (16 Million). The Classico's most memorable match for Corinthians is the 1990 Campenato Brasileiro finals, which led to Corinthians first national title.

## Classico Alvinegro

Classico Alvinegro is a regional fixture between Corinthians and Santos. 'Alvinegro' is given after the colors worn by both teams, black and white ( Alvi , from Latin albus , white, and negro , black). The Classico reached one of its highest stages for Corinthians supporters when Corinthians met Santos in the Semi-Finals of Libertadores 2012. Corinthians won 2-1 on aggregate.

## Other rivalries

Derby dos Invictos (Derby of the Undefeated), Corinthians and Portuguesa is a crosstown rivalry. Corinthians vs Ponte Preta is an in-state rivalry that peaked in the 1977 Campeonato Paulista final, which led to Ponte Preta's greatest Paulista Finish (runner-up). Classico das Multidões (Classic of The Masses) is an inter-state rivalry pegging the two most supported teams in Brazil: Corinthians and Flamengo. Corinthians and Vasco led to great match ups and some rivalry recently, mostly after Vasco winning the

Brasileirao in 1997 and 2000, and Corinthians in 1998 and 1999. Their greatest match coincided with the first FIFA Club World Cup in 2000, with a Corinthians victory in the penalty shootout. Corinthians also won the 2011 Brasileirao in the last round of the season, two points over the runners-up Vasco. Corinthians saved Vasco from their usual runner-up fate by defeating the cariocas in 2012 Libertadores Quarter-finals.

## Symbology

## Musketeer

Corinthians' official mascot is the Musketeer, a symbol of bravery, audacity and fighting spirit. The adoption of that character recalls the first years of the club.

In 1913 most of the leading football clubs in Sao Paulo State founded the APEA (Paulista Athletic Sports Association). The depleted Paulista League was left with only Americano, Germania and Internacional, known as the "three musketeers" of Sao Paulo football. Corinthians joined the three as D'Artagnan, being the fourth and most adored musketeer, just like in Alexandre Dumas, père's novel The Three Musketeers . To be accepted in that "musketeers universe", Corinthians had to show their bravery. As there was many other teams who coveted the spot in the Liga Paulista, Corinthians participated in a selective tournament against Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, two other great teams of Paulista amateur football at that time. The Corinthian team beat Minas 1-0 and Sao Paulo 4-0, earning acceptance into the group and

<!-- image -->

acquiring the right to participate in the Special Division of the Paulista League in the following year.

## Saint George

An important symbol for Corinthians is Saint George/(Ogum). Saint George is one of the most revered Catholic Saints in Brazil, a nation with a blend of cultures. The collusion between African & European cultures is seen in Brazil's definition of Sao Jorge as a mash between Catholicism & Western African Mythology. The comparison may be drawn the entities similar characteristics; St George, the soldier who protects those who pray to him; Ogum God of War who serves the communities who believe in him. it is this warrior demeanor that made Corinthians fans indebted to Sao Jorge.

Corinthians began as a small team for the lower classes of Sao Paulo, even though they obtained initial success. Lack of respect for the working class forced Corinthians to leave their Sao Paulo State Football League in protest. after multiple championships Timao made its largest leap in prestige in the founding of a Corinthians' Headquarters, 1926. The creation of said headquarters became the first fusion of Timao & Sao Jorge. The land purchased for the headquarters was formerly Parque Sao Jorge (St. George Park) at 777 Rua Sao Jorge, Tatuape, Sao Paulo, SP. [41]

Corinthians support for Sao Jorge became fanatical during the decade of the 60's, Between 1954 and 1977, Corinthians failed to add to its gallery of conquests and the Corinthian Nation lived the hardest moments of its history. While the stream struggled in the 60's, fan recanted that they were blessed by a "Santo Guerreiro" (Warrior Saint). In the early 60's the lack of success lingered in the minds of fans & gave birth to a utilization of the blessings of Sao Jorge. this caused Corinthians to erect a chapel in honor of the saint, in order to strengthen the clubs resolve via mysticism. 1969, after the death of two players Lidu & Eduardo, the funeral was held in Capela Sao Jorge, & strengthened the clubs identity at a time when championships were non-existent. 1974 Paulista Final, after a heart-wrenching loss to arch-rival Palmeiras, composer Paulinho Nogueira recorded "Oh Corinthians", a song that had popular commercial success at the time. In the verses of the composition dedicated to the suffering Corinthians could not miss the quote to the patron Saint George:

"...Oh, sao 20 anos de espera. Mas meu Sao Jorge me dê forcas, para poder um dia enfim, descontar meu sofrimento em quem riu de mim".

("... Oh, It's been 20 years of waiting, but my St. George gives me strength to be able to one day finally cashing in my suffering upon those who laughed at me. )"

Corinthians' 2011 third kit was burgundy colored & featured Sao Jorge slaughtering a dragon in a dark watermark across the right side of the chest. The utilization of Sao Jorge's image on the shirt is the practice of Sao Jorge's Prayer.
