# World championship
The FIFA Club World Cup (also known as Fifa World Championship) is an international men's association football competition organised by the FIFA, the sport's global governing body. The competition was first contested in 2000 as the FIFA Club World Championship. Following the 2023 edition, the tournament was revamped to a quadrennial competition starting in 2025. Views differ as to the cup's prestige: it struggles to attract interest in most of Europe, and is the object of heated debate in South America. 

Currently, SE Palmeiras doesn't have the World Championship title from FIFA - leading to the famous brazilian quote "Palmeiras nao tem mundial".

# Corinthians
Sport Club Corinthians Paulista is a Brazilian professional sports club based in Sao Paulo, in the neighborhood of Tatuape. Although it competes in multiple sports modalities, it is best known for its professional men's football team, which plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A, the top tier of Brazilian football, as well as in the Campeonato Paulista Serie A1, the first division of the traditional in-state competition.

Founded in 1910 by five railway workers inspired by the London-based Corinthian Football Club, Corinthians traditionally plays in a white and black home kit.

## Corinthians campaigns
Under the leadership of Socrates, Wladimir and Casagrande, Corinthians were the first Brazilian club in which players decided about concentracao, a common Brazilian practice where the football players were locked up in a hotel days before a game, and discussed politics. (In the early 1980s, military dictatorship, after two decades, ended in Brazil). In 1982, before the election of government of Sao Paulo State, the team wore a kit with the words: "DIA 15 VOTE" (Vote on 15th), trying to motivate the biggest number of fans to vote.

In 1990, Corinthians won their first Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A, beating their rivals, Sao Paulo in the final at the opponents' own stadium, Estadio do Morumbi. In the following year, Corinthians beat Flamengo and won the Supercopa do Brasil. In 1995, the club won the Copa do Brasil for the first time, beating Grêmio in the final at its home stadium, Estadio Olimpico Monumental in Porto Alegre. In the same decade, the club won the state championship in 1995, 1997 and 1999, and won the national championship again in 1998 and in 1999.

The club's situation in early 2004 was among the most difficult in their history. Bad administration, lack of money and terrible campaigns both in the 2003 Brazilian Championship and in the 2004 Sao Paulo State Championship caused their millions of supporters to worry. Fortunately, some young players and a new manager Tite helped the team to improve from their terrible start. At the end of the championship, Corinthians finished in 5th place and gained entry to the Copa Sudamericana (a minor continental championship, similar to Europa League).

In 2012, Corinthians won their second FIFA Club World Cup title after defeating Chelsea 1-0 in the final.

On 4 July, after reaching the final of the 2012 Copa Libertadores undefeated, Corinthians won its first title after a two-match final against 6-time champions Boca Juniors by drawing 1-1 in Argentina and winning 2-0 at the Estadio do Pacaembu in Sao Paulo, becoming the ninth Brazilian side to win the Copa Libertadores. The club won the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup after defeating English club Chelsea 1-0 on 16 December 2012.

## Stadiums
### Early grounds
The first playing ground Corinthians used was located in the neighborhood of Bom Retiro (where the club was founded in 1910), in a vacant lot owned by a firewood seller, from which it got its nickname: Campo do Lenheiro ("Lumberjack's field"). It was the time of the floodplain and the players themselves had to clean and flatten the lawn.

In January 1918, Corinthians inaugurated its first official football field, Ponte Grande , on the banks of Tiete River. The land was leased from the municipality under the influence of the intellectual Antonio de Alcantara Machado, one of the first to approach the club workers. It was built by the players and fans in a community helping system. The Corinthians played their games there until 1927, upon the completion of their first stadium. It was then donated to Sao Bento.

### Parque Sao Jorge
In 1926, the club purchased Parque Sao Jorge ("Saint George's Park"), located within the Tatuape district of the city, belonging to then rivals Esporte Clube Sirio, After purchasing, President Ernesto Cassano decided to reform the stage, with financial support from the members.

The renovated Parque Sao Jorge, still without floodlights, was inaugurated on 22 July, in a friendly game against America-RJ that ended in a 2-2 draw. The land purchased included a Syrian farm -hence the nickname Fazendinha ("Little Farm"), still used today. It was from here that the Corinthians began to develop and could build up its headquarters.

Due to their growing number of fans, Estadio Alfredo Schürig (the official name of "Fazendinha") and the commissioning of city-owned Pacaembu in the 1940s, from the 1950s the stadium was mostly used for Academy level competitions and friendly matches. The last first team match played there was a friendly against Brasiliense on 3 August 2002. Since 1997, it is also the home ground of the professional women's football team.

### Pacaembu
The club has established a relationship with Paulo Machado de Carvalho Stadium, which belongs to the municipality of Sao Paulo and is best known as Pacaembu Stadium, inaugurated in 1940 as the largest stadium in Latin America with a capacity of more than 70,000 people, in a double-fixture that pitted rivals Palestra Italia against Coritiba in the preliminary match and then current three-time state champion Corinthians against Atletico Mineiro, in a match Corinthians won by 4-2. Currently, the Pacaembu has capacity for up to 40,000 spectators.

### Arena Corinthians
On 1 September 2020 (Corinthians' 110th anniversary) a special event live from the stadium was held to announce the Arena's new name. It was officially renamed Neo Quimica Arena, part of a 20-year partnership with Hypera Pharma, Brazil's largest pharmaceutical company. Neo Quimica is Hypera's generic drugs division, which already served as Corinthians' main sponsor during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. The full contract is expected to be around R$300-320 million.

# Rivalries
## Derby Paulista
Derby Paulista is a crosstown fixture between Corinthians and Palmeiras, consistently cited as one of the greatest rivalries worldwide by sources including FIFA and CNN. Palmeiras was founded by a group of Italians who were formerly members of Corinthians. Since 1914, when that treasonous act was taken upon these former supporters, a deep-seated hatred was born.  The Derby atmosphere is fierce on and off the pitch, as violence is common between the clubs. Palmeiras home stadium and ground is Allianz Parque.

The Derby is often featured in Brazilian popular culture. The game is the central plot of Mazzaropi's film O Corintiano (1967), about a barber who is also a Corinthians fan that does not charge services from other Corinthians fans and does not like to provide services to Palmeiras fans. 

## Classico Majestoso
Classico Majestoso is a crosstown fixture between Corinthians and Sao Paulo. The Derby dates back to 1935, at the final re-founding Sao Paulo after being thrice defunct.

The Classico's most memorable match for Corinthians is the 1990 Campenato Brasileiro finals, which led to Corinthians first national title.

## Classico Alvinegro
Classico Alvinegro is a regional fixture between Corinthians and Santos. 'Alvinegro' is given after the colors worn by both teams, black and white ( Alvi , from Latin albus , white, and negro , black). The Classico reached one of its highest stages for Corinthians supporters when Corinthians met Santos in the Semi-Finals of Libertadores 2012. Corinthians won 2-1 on aggregate.

## Other rivalries
Derby dos Invictos (Derby of the Undefeated), Corinthians and Portuguesa is a crosstown rivalry. Corinthians vs Ponte Preta is an in-state rivalry that peaked in the 1977 Campeonato Paulista final, which led to Ponte Preta's greatest Paulista Finish (runner-up). Classico das Multidões (Classic of The Masses) is an inter-state rivalry pegging the two most supported teams in Brazil: Corinthians and Flamengo. Corinthians and Vasco led to great match ups and some rivalry recently, mostly after Vasco winning the

Brasileirao in 1997 and 2000, and Corinthians in 1998 and 1999. Their greatest match coincided with the first FIFA Club World Cup in 2000, with a Corinthians victory in the penalty shootout.
