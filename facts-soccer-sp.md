# World championship
The FIFA Club World Cup (also known as Fifa World Championship) is an international men's association football competition organised by the FIFA, the sport's global governing body. The competition was first contested in 2000 as the FIFA Club World Championship. Following the 2023 edition, the tournament was revamped to a quadrennial competition starting in 2025. Views differ as to the cup's prestige: it struggles to attract interest in most of Europe, and is the object of heated debate in South America. Sao Paulo FC (SPFC) and SC Corinthians have world championship titles.

Currently, SE Palmeiras doesn't have the World Championship title from FIFA - because of that, it gave birth to the famous brazilian quote "Palmeiras nao tem mundial".

# Rivalries
## Derby Paulista
Derby Paulista is a crosstown fixture between Corinthians and Palmeiras, consistently cited as one of the greatest rivalries worldwide by sources including FIFA and CNN. Palmeiras was founded by a group of Italians who were formerly members of Corinthians. Since 1914, when that treasonous act was taken upon these former supporters, a deep-seated hatred was born.  The Derby atmosphere is fierce on and off the pitch, as violence is common between the clubs. Palmeiras home stadium and ground is Allianz Parque.

The Derby is often featured in Brazilian popular culture. The game is the central plot of Mazzaropi's film O Corintiano (1967), about a barber who is also a Corinthians fan that does not charge services from other Corinthians fans and does not like to provide services to Palmeiras fans. 

## Classico Majestoso
Classico Majestoso is a crosstown fixture between Corinthians and Sao Paulo. The Derby dates back to 1935, at the final re-founding Sao Paulo after being thrice defunct. Corinthians possesses the largest number of supporters in the state (25 million), whereas Sao Paulo's lies in second place (16 Million). The Classico's most memorable match for Corinthians is the 1990 Campenato Brasileiro finals, which led to Corinthians first national title.
