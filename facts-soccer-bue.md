# City of Buenos Aires football scene
Football is life for many people in Buenos Aires, and attending a football match in your favourite team’s stadium is something of a ritual for many porteños.

Football is the most popular sport, both in terms of participants and spectators, in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires has one of the highest concentration of football teams of any city in the world (featuring at least 18 professional football teams), with many of its teams playing in the top tier "Primera División". This has led to the development of several rivalries within the city, contested as "derbys" when the regular league schedule brings these teams together, such as the Superclásico between Boca Juniors and River Plate – deemed one of the "50 sporting things you must do before you die" by The Observer. Other major clubs include Vélez Sarsfield, Ferro Carril Oeste and Argentinos Juniors.

Football in Argentina is like a religion, and the stadium is the church. Every week, football fans flock to their favourite team’s stadium to gather together in the collective ritual of football fanaticism. Attending a football match in Argentina is one of the quintessential Argentine experiences, and nowhere is this more true that in the capital of Buenos Aires, where the country’s two biggest rival teams reside: Boca Juniors and River Plate.

# Superclásico
Superclásico is the football match in Argentina between Buenos Aires rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate. It derives from the Spanish usage of "clásico" to mean derby, with the prefix "super" used as the two clubs are the most popular and successful clubs in Argentine football. In fact, the term 'Clásico' originated in Argentina, particularly with this match up and it was later exported to other countries such as Spain and Mexico.

The Superclásico is known worldwide as one of the fiercest and most important derbies and is also known as the "biggest club rivalry in world football".

The two clubs Boca and River Plate both have origins in La Boca, the working class dockland area of Buenos Aires, with River being founded in 1901 and Boca in 1905. River, however, moved to the affluent district of Núñez in the north of the city in 1925. Since then, Boca Juniors has been known as the club of Argentina's working class or the people's club, with many Boca fans coming from the local Italian immigrant community. Boca fans are actually known as Xeneizes. By contrast, River Plate became known by the nickname, Los Millonarios , with a supposedly upper-class support base. Both clubs, however, have supporters from all social classes.
