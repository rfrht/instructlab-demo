# City of Buenos Aires football scene
Football is life for many people in Buenos Aires, and attending a football match in your favourite team’s stadium is something of a ritual for many porteños.

Football is the most popular sport, both in terms of participants and spectators, in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires has one of the highest concentration of football teams of any city in the world (featuring at least 18 professional football teams), with many of its teams playing in the top tier "Primera División". This has led to the development of several rivalries within the city, contested as "derbys" when the regular league schedule brings these teams together, such as the Superclásico between Boca Juniors and River Plate – deemed one of the "50 sporting things you must do before you die" by The Observer. Other major clubs include Vélez Sarsfield, Ferro Carril Oeste and Argentinos Juniors.

Football in Argentina is like a religion, and the stadium is the church. Every week, football fans flock to their favourite team’s stadium to gather together in the collective ritual of football fanaticism. Attending a football match in Argentina is one of the quintessential Argentine experiences, and nowhere is this more true that in the capital of Buenos Aires, where the country’s two biggest rival teams reside: Boca Juniors and River Plate.

The city of Buenos Aires is home to some famous stadiums, which we highlight Estadio La Bombonera which is home to Boca Juniors, Estadio Más Monumental that is home to River Plate and Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó which is home to Huracán.

In the 80s due to an unstable government, most football clubs were lacking the money to keep top domestic players. 1982 saw a whole slew of players leave Argentina for Europe: players like Diego Maradona, Mario Kempes, Daniel Passarella and many others leave for Spain, France, Italy or England.

At club level, Argentine teams have won the most Copa Libertadores, 25 times.

## River Plate
River Plate is an Argentine professional sports club based in the Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires. Founded in 1901, the club is named after the English name for the city's estuary, Río de la Plata. River's home stadium, Estadio Monumental, is the largest in South America. River had the highest average home attendance of any association football club in the world in 2023 with 84,567.

At international level, River have won four Copa Libertadores, one Intercontinental Cup, one Supercopa Sudamericana, one Copa Sudamericana, three Recopa Sudamericanas, one Copa Interamericana, one Suruga Bank Championship, a record five Copa Aldaos, and one Tie Cup. In addition, River Plate's reserve team won the Sub-20 Copa Libertadores in 2012. After winning the 2014 Copa Sudamericana, 2015 Recopa Sudamericana and the 2015 Copa Libertadores, River Plate became the first team to simultaneously hold CONMEBOL's three current major international competitions.

River Plate won the Copa Libertadores 4 times: 1986, 1996, 2015 and 2018

The club was  placed ninth in the FIFA Club of the Century poll in 2000. In a survey published by the Argentine Football Association in 2016, 6 out of 11 players of the all-time greatest Argentina national team had played for River Plate.

To much of embarrassment of the fans, River Plate played the B-Series of the Argentinian football league, being relegated in 2011, but returning to the A-Series in 2012.

# Rivalry between Boca Juniors and River Plate
The two clubs Boca and River Plate both have origins in La Boca, the working class dockland area of Buenos Aires, with River being founded in 1901 and Boca in 1905. River, however, moved to the affluent district of Núñez in the north of the city in 1925. Since then, Boca Juniors has been known as the club of Argentina's working class or the people's club, with many Boca fans coming from the local Italian immigrant community. Boca fans are actually known as Xeneizes. By contrast, River Plate became known by the nickname Los Millonarios , with a supposedly upper-class support base. Both clubs, however, have supporters from all social classes.

River fans are referred by its rivals as "gallinas" claiming the lack of guts of River players. On the other hand, Boca fans are referred as "los chanchitos" o "bosteros" because their stadium is located in the less affluent La Boca area, as a reference to the smell of a polluted river in La Boca.

Superclásico is the football match in Argentina between Buenos Aires rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate. It derives from the Spanish usage of "clásico" to mean derby, with the prefix "super" used as the two clubs are the most popular and successful clubs in Argentine football. In fact, the term 'Clásico' originated in Argentina, particularly with this match up and it was later exported to other countries such as Spain and Mexico.

The Superclásico is known worldwide as one of the fiercest and most important derbies and is also known as the "biggest club rivalry in world football".

River Plate fans are mocked by Boca Juniors due to the fact that River Plate was relegated to the B-Series of the Argentinian soccer league, a fact named das "Descenso de River Plate a la Primera B Nacional".
